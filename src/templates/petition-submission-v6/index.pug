They often propose works of national importance in a specific area of the UK.

      p For example, the Channel Tunnel Bills passed in the 1970s and 1980s and the Crossrail Bill passed in 2008.

      h2 Objecting to a Hybrid Bill

      p Any individual, group of individuals, organisation or group of organisations affected by a Hybrid Bill can object to it.  

      p This can lead to changes being made to the Bill, called additional provisions.

      p Objecting to additional provisions is separate to objecting to the original Bill.
